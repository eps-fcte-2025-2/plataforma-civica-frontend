# How to contribute

## Creating an Issue
Creating issues is a great way to help us improve the project by reporting bugs, suggesting new features, or documenting enhancements.

### Did you find a bug?

1. **Ensure the bug was not already reported** 

Search on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/eps-fcte-2025-2/plataforma-civica-frontend/issues) to see if the problem has already been reported.

2. **Open a new Issue** 

If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Please provide as much relevant information as possible, such as:

* A step-by-step guide to reproducing the unexpected behavior.
* What you expected to happen vs. what actually happened.
* A code sample, screenshot, or video demonstrating the issue.

### Want to Suggest a New Feature?

1. **Check for existing requests** 

Before suggesting a new feature, please check the [Issues](https://github.com/eps-fcte-2025-2/plataforma-civica-frontend/issues). to see if it has already been requested.

2. **Open a new Issue**

If you can't find an open issue addressing the feature, open a new one. Provide a clear and detailed description explaining:

* The problem your feature aims to solve.
* The expected behavior of the new feature.

### Improving the Documentation
Good documentation is as important as good code. We welcome any help in making our docs clearer, more correct, and more complete. Improvements can range from fixing a simple typo to writing a new tutorial.

* **For small fixes** 

If you've found a typo, a broken link, or a sentence that could be clearer, feel free to open a Pull Request directly with the fix.

* **For major changes**

If you plan to rewrite a section, add a new guide, or make a structural change, please open an issue first to discuss your proposal. This ensures your effort aligns with the project's goals before you spend time on writing.
